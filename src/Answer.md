**PureComponent** is designed for performance optimization. It utilizes a shallow comparison of states, triggering a re-render only when there's a change in the state. For instance, if the toggle is false and the counter button is clicked, the state remains unchanged, preventing unnecessary re-rendering.

On the other hand, the **SimpleCounterComponent** lacks this optimization logic. It re-renders every time, irrespective of whether the states undergo any changes or not. This can lead to additional renders, potentially impacting performance.
